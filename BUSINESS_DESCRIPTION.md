## Company History and Evolution

### Founding and Early Years (2015-2017)

MediaVerse was founded by a team of entrepreneurs with backgrounds in retail, technology, and media. The company began as "BookVerse," a specialized online bookstore focused on rare and hard-to-find titles. The founders recognized a gap in the market for a platform that combined deep product knowledge with exceptional customer service.

In its first year, BookVerse focused exclusively on books, building relationships with publishers, distributors, and independent authors. The company developed proprietary systems for inventory management, customer recommendations, and order fulfillment. By 2016, BookVerse had expanded to include audiobooks and e-books, establishing partnerships with major publishers.

### Expansion Phase (2018-2020)

Recognizing the opportunity to serve customers' broader needs, the company rebranded to MediaVerse in 2018 and expanded into two new verticals:

1. **Consumer Products Division**: Launched with a curated selection of lifestyle products, electronics accessories, home goods, and collectibles. The division focused on products that complemented the reading and entertainment experience.

2. **Media Distribution Division**: Entered the film and entertainment market, initially focusing on physical media (DVDs, Blu-rays) and later expanding to digital distribution partnerships.

The expansion was supported by significant technology investments, including the development of a unified inventory management system, customer relationship management platform, and data analytics infrastructure. MediaVerse raised Series A and Series B funding rounds, enabling rapid growth in inventory, customer base, and geographic reach.

### Maturity and Optimization (2021-Present)

From 2021 onward, MediaVerse has focused on operational excellence, supply chain optimization, and data-driven decision making. The company has:

- Implemented advanced analytics and business intelligence systems
- Developed sophisticated recommendation engines using machine learning
- Expanded into international markets
- Built strategic partnerships with content creators, manufacturers, and distributors
- Launched subscription services and loyalty programs

## Data Collection and Updates

### Data Scraping and Collection Process

MediaVerse continuously collects and updates data about its inventory, book catalog, and film catalog through automated data collection processes. The term **"scraping date"** (scrp_dt) refers to the timestamp when data about a specific item (product, book, or film) was collected or last updated in the system. This process ensures that:

- **New items are added** to inventory, catalog, or media collections as they become available
- **Existing item information is updated** with current pricing, availability, descriptions, and metadata
- **Data freshness is maintained** to support accurate business decisions and customer-facing information
- **Historical tracking** enables analysis of catalog growth, pricing trends, and inventory changes over time

The scraping process runs on a regular schedule, collecting data from multiple sources including supplier feeds, publisher databases, distributor systems, and public sources. Each time an item's data is collected or updated, the scraping date is recorded, allowing the business to track when information was last refreshed and analyze patterns in data collection and catalog growth.

### Business Context for Data Updates

- **Inventory Updates**: Products are added to inventory when new stock arrives, when new products are launched, or when supplier catalogs are updated. The scraping date helps track inventory growth and identify when new products entered the system.

- **Catalog Updates**: Books are added to the catalog when new titles are published, when used books are acquired, or when availability changes. The scraping date enables tracking of catalog expansion and identification of recently added titles.

- **Media Updates**: Films and media content are added when new releases become available, when distributor catalogs are updated, or when metadata (directors, actors, awards) is refreshed. The scraping date helps track media catalog growth and identify recently added content.
